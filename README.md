# SnoozeStreak is a sleep app that our group, Team 07, developed as part of the Next Program Pilot. The Cigna Group had given us this prompt:

# The Cigna Group offers a multitude of health services to clients, employers and over 178 million patients around the world. When people make healthy decisions, everyone wins.
# One area of general health that is often overlooked is getting quality rest. But many factors can impede that goal. Your task is to develop a technical solution to improve the behaviors that impact successful sleeping patterns.
# You will design and create a three-tier web application that addresses this use case. You will deploy your solution to the AWS cloud and make a presentation to various business and technical leaders.

# In response, our team succeeded in creating a three-tier web application that allows users to log their sleeping habits and receive feedback, alarms, and timers, based on their sleeping habits and initial onboarding survey. We used Figma to prototype our designs, used React for the frontend, and were able to use our AWS learner lab accounts to host our website on S3 and utilize AWS Lambda, Dynamo, and API Gateway for our backend. 

# Note: This project is not completely finished and was done for our own development. We presented on what we had learned and won 1st place during our presentation to panelists at The Cigna Group.
